# EXOLITE

Exolite is an exspansion onto the capabilities of popular package express, providing a dashboard-style management for web development.

Note: This is still very much in development, and usability and key features are not accessible at this moment.

# Useage

```js
const exolite = require ('exolite');

exolite.listen();
```
